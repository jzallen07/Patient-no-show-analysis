# Patient-no-show-analysis
A look into factors behind patient no showing up to their doctor appointments


## Background

Patient no shows for appointments are a conssitent occurence in medicine as they are in many service based industries. Though, appoint should never
really be cancelled due to a prediction that a patient will not show it could be argued that such predictions could allow for predictive fill-in appointments
e.g. a patient on a wait list could be given notice. Either way the ability to have greater insight into factors that are associated with patient no show
might allow us to make changes to the system and/or how we handle things from a medical provider perspective to decrease this likelyhood and get more patients showing up.
Further, if healthcare providers are consistently doing things that contribute to patient no show we should investigate simply on a matter of improving care.
